# Manage Books UX Round 2 — Investigations log

**Purpose:** rolling investigation record for the [round-2 design](./2026-05-11-manage-books-ux-review-followup-design.md). Each stage appends its own section before implementation begins, per the per-stage investigation workflow established in §3a of the design doc.

**Process per stage:**

1. **Stage N.0 — Investigate.** Read relevant code; verify spec premises; surface findings + open questions in this file
2. **Checkpoint.** Pause, surface findings to user, wait for go-ahead or correction
3. **Stage N.1+ — Implement.** Per the (possibly revised) plan
4. Update this file's "Decision" subsection with the final call

**Template per stage:**

```markdown
## Stage N — Investigation (YYYY-MM-DD)

### What I looked at

- file:line references read
- behaviors observed (in app, in tests, in PT9 source)

### Findings vs the spec

- ✅ Spec is correct on X
- ⚠️ Spec assumed Y, actual is Z
- ❓ Open question that needs user input

### Proposed deviation from spec (if any)

- ...

### Decision (filled after user checkpoint)

- ...
```

For Stages 5, 6, 7, the investigation also produces a **characterization test** (a small test pinning current observable behavior) committed _before_ the code change. Reference its commit hash in the stage's section.
