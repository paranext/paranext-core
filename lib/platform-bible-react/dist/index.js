     * `getElementsByTagName` lower-cases the argument before searching for it.
     * This is undesirable when trying to match camel-cased SVG elements (such as
     * `<linearGradient>`) in an HTML document.
     * Instead, use `Element.getElementsByTagNameNS()`,
     * which preserves the capitalization of the tag name.
     *
     * `Element.getElementsByTagName` is similar to `Document.getElementsByTagName()`,
     * except that it only searches for elements that are descendants of the specified element.
