Products:
Paratext 10 Studio
Paratext 9
Platform.Bible

Features:
 - Sync (formerly Send/Receive). We call it Sync because it has become a much more common feature and normal word to people. We're also improving upon the technology to make it a simpler experience that doesn't require so much worry and babysitting.
 - Real-time collaborative editing. A technology that allows multiple users to edit the same digital document simultaneously from different devices. As each user makes changes, those edits are synchronized and merged almost instantaneously across all participants' views, minimizing conflicts and ensuring everyone is working on the most current version of the document. This is commonly seen in tools like Google Docs, where several people can type, delete, and format text at the same time, with changes immediately visible to all. Unlike Paratext Live, we're building Real-time collaborative editing to be able to stay on all the time without the elaborate setup process of Paratext Live.
