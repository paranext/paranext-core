# Capitalization Rules

Consistent capitalization improves clarity and usability in our design system. We use **sentence case** for all interface text and documentation, except for specific product names and proper nouns.

## Why We Use Sentence Case

We choose sentence case because:

- **Clarity:** It’s easier to distinguish proper nouns and special terms from regular words, reducing confusion for users.
- **Consistency:** Sentence case is simpler to apply across different languages and platforms, making localization and maintenance easier. Rules for title case can also vary widely and contentiously within languages.
- **Readability:** Studies show sentence case is easier to read, especially for longer phrases or sentences.
- **Approachability:** It feels more conversational and less overwhelming for the reader than title case.

> “Sentence case respects the difference between proper nouns and the other words.”

## Core Rules

- **Use sentence case** for all headings, labels, buttons, and body text.
  - Example: “Get started with your project”
- **Always capitalize specific product names and proper nouns** as listed below.

## Product and Feature Names
- **Paratext products and features:**
  - Paratext
  - Paratext 10 Studio
  - Platform.Bible

- **Apple products:**
  - macOS
  - iOS
  - iPhone

## Examples

- Correct:
  - “Sign in to Platform.Bible on your iPhone”
  - “Install Paratext 10 Studio on macOS”
  - “Learn more about Paratext features”

- Incorrect:
  - “Sign In To Platform.bible On Your Iphone”
  - “Install paratext 10 studio on MacOS”
  - “Learn More About paratext Features”

## Summary

- Use sentence case everywhere, except for product names and proper nouns, which must always be capitalized correctly.
- This approach keeps our design system clear, consistent, and user-friendly.
