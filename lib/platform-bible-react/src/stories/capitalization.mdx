# Capitalization rules

Consistent capitalization improves clarity and usability in our design system. We use **sentence case** for all interface text and documentation, except for specific product names and proper nouns.

## Why we use sentence case

We choose sentence case because:

* **Clarity:** It’s easier to distinguish proper nouns and special terms from regular words, reducing confusion for users.
* **Consistency:** Sentence case is simpler to apply across different languages and platforms, making localization and maintenance easier. Rules for title case can also vary widely and contentiously within languages.
* **Readability:** Studies show sentence case is easier to read, especially for longer phrases or sentences.
* **Approachability:** It feels more conversational and less overwhelming for the reader than title case.

> “Sentence case respects the difference between proper nouns and the other words.”

## Core rules

* **Use sentence case** for all headings, labels, buttons, and body text.
  * Example: “Get started with your project”
* **Always capitalize specific product names and proper nouns** as listed below.

## Product and feature names

* **Paratext products and features:**

  * Paratext
  * Paratext 10 Studio
  * Platform.Bible

* **Apple products:**
  * macOS
  * iOS
  * iPhone

## Examples

* Correct:

  * “Sign in to Platform.Bible on your iPhone”
  * “Install Paratext 10 Studio on macOS”
  * “Learn more about Paratext features”

* Incorrect:
  * “Sign In To Platform.bible On Your Iphone”
  * “Install paratext 10 studio on MacOS”
  * “Learn More About paratext Features”

## Summary

* Use sentence case everywhere, except for product names and proper nouns, which must always be capitalized correctly.
* This approach keeps our design system clear, consistent, and user-friendly.
