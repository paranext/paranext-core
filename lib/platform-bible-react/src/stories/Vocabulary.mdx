# Vocabulary

Vocabulary isnâ€™t a glossary or a dictionary. It contains usage guidelines for terms specific to products, extensions, and training in the Paratext Ecosystem.

To recommend additions, [email the UX team](mailto:feedback+studio@paratext.org) or make a pull request to [this file on Github](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core/tree/main/src/stories/Vocabulary.mdx).

## User-facing vocabulary

### my vs. your

Use "your", not "my", in the UI and related text

Using second person maintains a consistent voice and promotes a friendly, conversational quality. While "my" can feel personal, it risks encroaching on a user's sense of personal space and attributing choices to them that they haven't made. "Your" is clearer and avoids confusion because it can be used more consistently. For example, try writing this error message with "my":

```diff
+ The following files are different from the shared project.  Do you wish to overwrite them with the shared project files?
- The following files are different from the shared project.  Do I wish to overwrite them with the shared project files?
```

Since some messages are best given in the second person, we use "your" to refer to the user. This keeps the focus on the user's actions and choices, while still allowing for a personal touch when needed.

### entry

Use entry to refer to a single item in a list.

### filter

Use filter for UI elements that narrow down lists by type, language, or other criteria.

## Development vocabulary

### badge

Use badge for small UI elements that highlight status or category (e.g., installed, update available).

### muted

Use muted for text or UI elements that are less prominent, often for secondary information.

### ghost

Use ghost for control styles with very low emphasis. Ghost styles lack visual indications of their bounds, such as background color or border (unless they're hovered or focused). Ghost styles are often used in toolbars, dropdowns, or secondary actions.

  ## Vocabulary that needs to be written

  * resource
  * action
  * command


  ## genAI drafts for consideration

  ### install vs. get
  Use get for actions that download and install a resource in one step. Use install only when the process is distinct from downloading.

  "Get" is friendlier and less technical, making it more approachable for users.

  ### open vs. view
  Use open for actions that launch a resource or project. Use view for read-only or preview actions.

  "Open" implies full access and editing, while "view" suggests limited interaction.

  ### remove vs. delete
  Use remove for actions that take a resource out of the app but do not erase it from disk. Use delete only when the resource is permanently erased.

  "Remove" is safer and less alarming for users, reducing fear of accidental loss.

  ### update
  Use update for actions that bring a resource to its latest version.

  Avoid "refresh" or "upgrade" unless those terms have specific technical meaning.

  ### type
  Use type to refer to the category of a resource (e.g., Scripture, Enhanced Resource).

  ### language
  Use language to refer to the language of a resource. Avoid "locale" unless discussing localization or translation features.

  ### card
  Use card for UI containers that group related information visually.

  ### table
  Use table for UI elements that display resources in rows and columns.

  ### label
  Use label for text elements that identify or describe UI components.

  ### dropdown
  Use dropdown for menus that expand to show options.

  ### combo box
  Use combo box for UI elements that combine a dropdown with text input.

  ### header

  ### update available
  Use update available to indicate resources that can be updated to a newer version.
