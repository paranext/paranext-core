# Capitalization rules

Consistent capitalization improves clarity and usability in our design system. We use **sentence case** for all interface text and documentation, except for specific product names and proper nouns.

## Why we use sentence case

Sentence case is easier to read and scan quickly. It follows standard English conventions and feels more natural, especially for longer text strings. Research shows that sentence case improves comprehension and reduces cognitive load.

### Examples of sentence case:

* **Buttons**: "Save changes", "Delete item", "Add new project"
* **Menu items**: "Project settings", "Export data", "User preferences"
* **Form labels**: "Email address", "Password confirmation", "Project name"
* **Headings**: "Getting started", "Advanced features", "Troubleshooting guide"

## When to use title case

Use title case sparingly and only for:

* **Product names**: "Platform.Bible", "Paranext"
* **Proper nouns**: Names of people, places, organizations
* **API names**: Specific technical terms that are established as proper nouns

## Special considerations

### Abbreviations and acronyms

* Keep established abbreviations in their standard form: "URL", "API", "JSON"
* Don't force sentence case on well-known technical terms

### Brands and external services

* Respect the official capitalization of external brands and services
* Examples: "GitHub", "YouTube", "macOS"

### Code and technical terms

* Follow the established conventions of the programming language or framework
* Component names in React follow PascalCase: `Button`, `DialogContent`
* CSS classes follow kebab-case: `.search-bar`, `.dialog-overlay`

## Implementation guidelines

1. **Review all UI text** for consistent sentence case application
2. **Update style guides** to reflect these capitalization rules
3. **Use linting tools** where possible to catch inconsistencies
4. **Train team members** on these conventions during onboarding

Remember: Consistency is more important than perfection. When in doubt, choose sentence case and apply it consistently throughout the interface.
