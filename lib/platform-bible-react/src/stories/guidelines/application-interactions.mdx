# Application wide interaction patterns

Consistent interaction patterns are important for users to feel comfortable and confident while using the application.

## Tab navigation
Tabs can be navigated using keyboard shortcuts:
- `Ctrl + Tab` to move to the next tab
- `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` to move to the previous tab

New Tabs can be opened by
- Pressing the `+` button. This will bring up the `New Tab` dialog on the newly opened tab.
- Pressing the Home button or selecting any option from the menu that launches a specific new tab.

If more tabs are present they will overflow into a menu accessible on hover of the `↕` button.

## Layout

Tabs can be rearranged by dragging and dropping them into the desired position.

Tabs can be floated by right clicking on the tab header and selecting `Float Tab` from the context menu.

Floating tabs can be docked back into the main window by dragging and dropping them back into the tab header bar.

## Scripture editor ↔ lists
Following diagram shows how the scripture editor interacts with lists of items in projects / resources or list of scripture pieces.
Examples: Comments, Check Results, Find Results, Footnotes, Occurrences, etc.

Interactions exist in both directions:
- from scripture editor: `on scripture reference change`, `on annotation or caller selection`, `on command / shortcut key press`
- from list: `on hover`, `on single click`, `on double click`, `on reference click`
and respective keyboard interactions
