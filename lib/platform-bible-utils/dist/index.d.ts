 * - The equals sign for closing marker attributes (no official representation)
 * - The quotes around closing marker attribute values (no official representation)
 * - The space between closing marker attributes (no official representation)
 *
 * Also note that the following types do not specify a concrete location that is actually in the USJ
 * document but represent a USFM location relative to the most similar thing in USJ that there is:
 *
 * - {@link UsjClosingMarkerLocation} - there are no distinct closing objects in JSON; there is a
 *   common syntax for closing every object, but it is only one character and is on every single
 *   object as opposed to USFM closing markers which are multiple characters long and are only
 *   sometimes present.
 * - {@link UsjAttributeKeyLocation} - when the attribute whose key is being pointed to is an attribute
 *   marker in USFM, the `keyOffset` does not apply to the USJ attribute name (e.g. `altnumber`) but
 *   to the USFM attribute marker name (e.g. `ca`).
 * - {@link UsjAttributeMarkerLocation} - attribute markers are just properties in JSON; they do not
 *   have their own object such that they would have an opening that can be pointed to in the JSON
 *   like they have their own opening in USFM.
 * - {@link UsjClosingAttributeMarkerLocation} - attribute markers are just properties in JSON, plus
 *   they are in the same situation as {@link UsjClosingMarkerLocation} as detailed above.
 *
 * To see many examples of the same point represented by both USFM and USJ locations, go to
 * https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core/tree/main/lib/platform-bible-utils/src/scripture/usj-reader-writer-test-data/testUSFM-2SA-1-locations.ts

 *
 *   - `usfmVerseLocationToUsjDocumentLocation`

 *
 * - "node" is a term used in the methods in this class that usually means an object or content string

 *   situations, it may refer only to {@link MarkerObject} or {@link MarkerContent}. The TypeScript
 *   types indicate when this is the case.
 * - See {@link UsfmVerseLocation} and {@link UsjDocumentLocation} for information about transforming
 *   USFM locations and USJ locations including what kinds of USFM locations are and are not
 *   representable in USJ locations, which USJ locations actually correspond to something in USJ,
 *   etc.
 * - It is best to reuse the same `UsjReaderWriter` for the same USJ document as long as possible
 *   because there is a significant amount of processing and caching done internally to facilitate
 *   various operations. Note that, if the USJ document added to `UsjReaderWriter` changes, you must
