This folder contains markers maps for versions of USFM we want to include in `UsjReaderWriter`. These markers maps are generated in the [`usfm-tools`](https://github.com/paranext/usfm-tools) repository. You can run the Generate Markers Map workflow and get a markers map for which version of USFM you want to use in `UsjReaderWriter` if the version you want to use is not one of the included versions.

Note: USFM 3.1 and up have [a specific versioning scheme](https://github.com/usfm-bible/tcdocs/blob/main/docs/USFMTC%20Versioning.md) that is NOT semantic versioning. As such, we are for now assuming that the 3.1 markers map will only work with USFM 3.1.

It appears that USFM 3.0 and 3.0.x are all intended to represent the same USFM but are just small fixes. As such, we are for now assuming any 3.0.x markers map will work with any USFM 3.0 or 3.0.x.
