# paranext-multi-extension-template

Template for creating multiple Platform.Bible extensions in one repo

<!-- <!-- Opening comment tag for Template Info Section. Ignore this for now. More info in [Hide Template Info](#hide-template-info). -->

## Template Info

This is a Webpack project template pre-configured to build an arbitrary number of Platform.Bible extensions. It includes only the bare essentials required for a multi-extension repository to work.

Note that many of the files mentioned in [Summary](#summary) are not present in this template because they describe extension code which must be added to this template. For examples of what extensions in a multi-extension repo might look like, refer to any repo based on this template â€” for instance, the [platform-bible-sample-extensions](https://github.com/paranext/platform-bible-sample-extensions).

**Important:** Before proceeding to use this template, consider whether you intend to build a single extension to be packaged and installed independently, or a set of related extensions that should be used together. If the former, it would be better to use the simple [template pre-configured to build a single Platform.Bible extension](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template).

### Customize repo details

Follow these instructions to customize the template to be your own Platform.Bible extension repo.

#### Install and hook up to the template

To make the process of customizing from the template as smooth as possible, we recommend you do the following before anything else:

- [Install and set up this repo](#to-install)
- [Update this repo from the template](#to-update-this-repo-and-extensions-from-the-templates) to hook everything up for smooth updates in the future

#### Replace placeholders

For your extension name, we recommend that you use [lowerCamelCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Camel_case) in some contexts and [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) in other contexts. We generally recommend lowerCamelCase when using the name in code (like making a new command on the PAPI, for example), and we recommend kebab-case when using the name in relation to the file system, the repository, `npm`, and the extension's `.d.ts` types module. The following instructions are written accordingly.

- At the top of this `README.md`:

  - Replace the first line `# paranext-multi-extension-template` with `# your-extension-repo-name` (kebab-case)
  - Below the first line, replace the repo description with your own description

- In `package.json`:

  - Replace `paranext-multi-extension-template` with `your-extension-repo-name` (kebab-case)
  - Update ownership information and other relevant fields as desired

- In `LICENSE`:

  - Adjust as desired (feel free to choose a different license)
  - If you choose to stay with the current license, update the copyright statement

- In `.github/assets/release-body.md`, make adjustments as desired

#### Create your first extension in this repo

Follow the steps in [To create a new extension in this repo](#to-create-a-new-extension-in-this-repo) to create your first extension in this repo! You can follow the same steps to create new extensions as desired.

#### Hide Template Info

Once finished customizing this template to be your own, you can uncomment the [HTML comment tag](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) above the [Template Info](#template-info) section to hide this template-related info in this readme. You can do this by clicking on the line and doing CTRL + / in VS Code. You can also do this manually by removing the first opening '&lt;!--' and the only closing '--&gt;' on the line. Leaving this info commented in your readme will hide it in your readme while avoiding merge conflicts if you decide to [update this repo and extensions from the templates](#to-update-this-repo-and-extensions-from-the-templates) in the future. If you never want to update this repo and extensions from the templates, you can remove the [Template Info](#template-info) section and sub-sections of this readme.

Note: if you [update this repo and extensions from the templates](#to-update-this-repo-and-extensions-from-the-templates), there may be important changes in this section like additional customizations you must make to this repo. Please keep an eye out for readme changes when updating from the template.

## Summary

This is a Webpack project configured to build Platform.Bible extensions. The general file structure is as follows:

- `src/` contains the source code for all extensions
  - Each sub-folder in `src/` with a `manifest.json` in it is an extension
    - `package.json` contains information about this extension's npm package. It is required for Platform.Bible to use the extension properly. It is copied into the build folder
    - `manifest.json` is the manifest file that defines the extension and important properties for Platform.Bible. It is copied into the build folder
    - `src/` contains the source code for the extension
      - `src/main.ts` is the main entry file for the extension
      - `src/types/<extension-name>.d.ts` is this extension's types file that defines how other extensions can use this extension through the `papi`
      - `*.web-view.tsx` files will be treated as React WebViews
      - `*.web-view.html` files are a conventional way to provide HTML WebViews (no special functionality)
    - `assets/` contains asset files the extension and its WebViews can retrieve using the `papi-extension:` protocol, as well as textual descriptions in various languages. It is copied into the build folder
      - `assets/displayData.json` contains (optionally) a path to the extension's icon file as well as text for the extension's display name, short summary, and path to the full description file
      - `assets/descriptions/` contains textual descriptions of the extension in various languages
        - `assets/descriptions/description-<locale>.md` contains a brief description of the extension in the language specified by `<locale>`
    - `contributions/` contains JSON files the platform uses to extend data structures for things like menus and settings. The JSON files are referenced from the manifest
    - `public/` contains other static files that are copied into the build folder
- `.github/` contains files to facilitate integration with GitHub
  - `.github/workflows` contains [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows for automating various processes in this repo
  - `.github/assets/release-body.md` combined with a generated changelog becomes the body of [releases published using GitHub Actions](#publishing)
- `dist/` is a generated folder containing the built extension files
- `release/` is a generated folder containing zips of the built extension files

> See the [Extension Anatomy wiki page](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template/wiki/Extension-Anatomy) for more information about the various files that comprise extensions and their relationships to each other.

## To install

### Install dependencies

1. Follow the instructions to install [`paranext-core`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core#developer-install). We recommend you clone `paranext-core` in the same parent directory in which you cloned this repository so you do not have to [reconfigure paths](#configure-paths-to-paranext-core-repo) to `paranext-core`.
2. In this repo, run `npm install` to install local and published dependencies

Note: running `npm install` automatically adds remotes that help with [updating from the templates](#to-update-this-repo-and-extensions-from-the-templates).

<details>
    <summary>[Optional] Adding remotes manually</summary>

#### Adding remotes manually

To add these remotes manually, run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add paranext-multi-extension-template https://github.com/paranext/paranext-multi-extension-template

git remote add paranext-extension-template https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template
```

</details>

### Configure paths to `paranext-core` repo

If you cloned `paranext-core` anywhere other than in the same parent directory in which you cloned this repository, update the paths to `paranext-core` in this repository's `package.json` to point to the correct `paranext-core` directory.

## To run

### Running Platform.Bible with these extensions

To run Platform.Bible with these extensions:

`npm start`

Note: The built extensions will be the `dist` folder. In order for Platform.Bible to run these extensions, you must provide the directory to these built extensions to Platform.Bible via a command-line argument. This command-line argument is already provided in this `package.json`'s `start` script. If you want to start Platform.Bible and use these extensions any other way, you must provide this command-line argument or put the `dist` folder into Platform.Bible's `extensions` folder.

### Building these extensions independently

To watch extension files (in `src`) for changes:

`npm run watch`

To build the extensions once:

`npm run build`

## To package for distribution

To package these extensions into a zip file for distribution:

`npm run package`

## Publishing

These steps will walk you through releasing a version on GitHub and bumping the version to a new version so future changes apply to the new in-progress version. These release workflows and scripts expect that all extensions in this repo are on the same version.

1. Make sure the versions in this repo are on the version number you want to release. If they are not, manually dispatch the [Bump Versions workflow](#bumping-version-without-publishing-a-release) or run the `bump-versions` npm script to set the versions to what you want to release on the branch you want to release from.

2. Manually dispatch the Publish workflow in GitHub Actions targeting the branch you want to release from. This workflow creates a new pre-release for the version you intend to release and creates a new `bump-versions-<next_version>` branch to bump the version after the release so future changes apply to a new in-progress version instead of to the already released version. This workflow has the following inputs:

   - `version`: Enter the version you intend to publish (e.g. 0.2.0). This is simply for verification to make sure you release the code that you intend to release. It is compared to the version in the code, and the workflow will fail if they do not match.
   - `newVersionAfterPublishing`: Enter the version you want to bump to after releasing (e.g. 0.3.0-alpha.0). Future changes will apply to this new version instead of to the version that was already released. Leave blank if you don't want to bump.
   - `bumpRef`: Enter the Git ref you want to create the bump versions branch from, e.g. `main`. Leave blank if you want to use the branch selected for the workflow run. For example, if you release from a stable branch named `release-prep`, you may want to bump the version on `main` so future development work happens on the new version, then you can rebase `release-prep` onto `main` when you are ready to start preparing the next stable release.

    <details>
        <summary>[Optional] Create a new pre-release and bump versions branch manually </summary>

   #### Manually create a new pre-release and bump versions branch

   Alternatively, you can create a new pre-release manually:

   ```bash
   npm run package
   # Create a new pre-release in GitHub on tag `v<version>`
   # Copy `.github/assets/release-body.md` into the release body
   # Press the "Generate release notes" button in the release creation page to generate a changelog
   # Attach contents of `release` folder to the release
   ```

   Then bump versions by running the following:

   ```bash
   npm run bump-versions <next_version>
   ```

   Or bump versions manually:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b bump-versions-<next_version>
   npm version <next_version> --git-tag-version false
   # cd to each extension folder
   npm version <next_version> --git-tag-version false
   # Change version in each extension's `manifest.json`
   git commit -a -m "Bumped versions to <next_version>"; git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

    </details>

3. In GitHub, adjust the new draft release's body and other metadata as desired, then publish the release.
4. Open a PR and merge the newly created `bump-versions-<next_version>` branch.

### Bumping version without publishing a release

Sometimes, it may be useful to change the version without [publishing a release](#publishing).

To bump versions without publishing a release, manually dispatch the Bump Versions workflow in GitHub Actions targeting the branch on which you want to change versions. Alternatively, you can run the `bump-versions` npm script. This workflow will create a branch named `bump-versions-<version>` from the target branch (or, if running the script, your current head) with the needed changes. Open a PR and merge that new branch into the branch on which you want to change versions.

This workflow has the following inputs:

- `newVersion`: enter the version you want to bump to (e.g. 0.3.0-alpha.0). Future changes will apply to this new version instead of to the version.

For example, to bump branch `my-branch` to version `0.2.0`, run the following:

```bash
git checkout my-branch
npm run bump-versions -- 0.2.0
```

Then create a PR and merge the `bump-versions-0.2.0` branch into `my-branch`. `my-branch` is now ready for release.

### Publishing problems

Following are some problems you may encounter while publishing and steps to solve them.

#### `@swc/core` Failed to load native binding

If you see the following error in the GitHub Actions workflow logs while packaging:

```
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/swc-loader/src/index.js):
Error: Failed to load native binding
```

Please see ["Failed to load native binding" in the Troubleshooting guide for how to solve this problem](https://github.com/paranext/paranext/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide#failed-to-load-native-binding).

## To create a new extension in this repo

To create a new extension in this repo, make sure your repo has no working changes, then run the following command (replace `<extension-name>` with the preferred extension name. This will also be the extension's folder name in the `src` folder. We strongly recommend using kebab-case for this name):

```bash
npm run create-extension -- <extension-name>
```

Then follow [the instructions for customizing the new extension](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template#customize-extension-details) with a few modifications:

- All of the places where it says to replace the extension name in [Replace Placeholders](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template#replace-placeholders) have been automated,
  the other instructions there should apply inside the `src/<extension-name>` folder, not at this repo root.
- Instead of editing the `.github/assets/release-body.md` inside the extension, add information about the new extension in `.github/assets/release-body.md` at this repo root.

**Note:** The merge/squash commits created when creating a new extension are important; Git uses them to compare the files for future updates. If you edit this repo's Git history, please preserve these commits (do not squash them, for example) to avoid duplicated merge conflicts in the future.

<details>
    <summary>[Optional] Creating a new extension manually</summary>

### Manually create a new extension

Alternatively, you can create a new extension manually:

```bash
git fetch paranext-extension-template main

git subtree add --prefix src/<extension-name> paranext-extension-template main --squash
```

After running these commands, run a regex find and replace inside the new extension folder to fix
the file paths pointing to `paranext-core`:

- Find: `([^/])\.\.\/paranext-core`
- Replace with: `$1../../../paranext-core`

You can ignore occurrences from many files. Please see [`./lib/git.util.ts`](./lib/git.util.ts) -> `formatExtensionFolder` for more information.

Because these steps are not automated you need to follow all the instructions in [Replace Placeholders](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template#replace-placeholders)

</details>

### Renaming an extension

Renaming an extension involves more than just changing its folder name. Tools that track extension updates rely on the folder name to detect changes, so renaming must be done carefully to avoid duplicated diffs or future merge conflicts.

**Note:** Unfortunately, this process effectively erases the history on all the files in this extension since they are being deleted and created anew from the perspective of the Git history.

To safely rename an extension:

1. [Update from the template](#to-update-this-repo-and-extensions-from-the-templates) to ensure the extension to be renamed has all latest changes (makes sure you don't revert any updates the template has received since you last updated the extension when you are copying the contents of the extension)

2. Run the [`create-extension` script](#to-create-a-new-extension-in-this-repo) with the new name to create a new folder:
   ```bash
   npm run create-extension -- <new-extension-name>
   ```
3. Move the contents of the old extension into the new folder and delete the old folder. (If it's not already under source control, it would probably be wise to make a backup until you have confirmed that the rename was successful.)

4. Update internal identifiers and references to match the new name (e.g., folder names, class names, package names, strings inside files).

5. Test and commit the changes.

This process ensures that template update comparisons continue to work correctly.

**Note:** The merge/squash commits created when renaming an extension are important; Git uses them to compare the files for future updates. If you edit this repo's Git history, please preserve these commits (do not squash them, for example) to avoid duplicated merge conflicts in the future.

## To update this repo and extensions from the templates

This project is forked from [`paranext-multi-extension-template`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-multi-extension-template), and its extensions are derived from [`paranext-extension-template`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template). Both are updated periodically and will sometimes receive updates that help with breaking changes on [`paranext-core`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core). We recommend you periodically update your repo and extensions by merging the latest template updates into them.

To update this repo including all extensions to have the latest updates and upgrades from the templates, make sure your repo has no working changes, then run the following `npm` script:

```bash
npm run update-from-templates
```

If you encounter errors from merge conflicts, please resolve the merge conflicts, finish the commit, and run the script above again.

For more information, read [the instructions on the Paranext Extension Template wiki](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template/wiki/Merging-Template-Changes-into-Your-Extension).

**Note:** The merge/squash commits created when updating this repo and its extensions from the templates are important; Git uses them to compare the files for future updates. If you edit this repo's Git history, please preserve these commits (do not squash them, for example) to avoid duplicated merge conflicts in the future.

<details>
    <summary>[Optional] Update from the templates manually</summary>

### Update from the templates manually

Alternatively, you can update from the templates manually.

#### Manually update this repo from `paranext-multi-extension-template`

```bash
git fetch paranext-multi-extension-template main

git merge paranext-multi-extension-template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

#### Manually update extensions from `paranext-extension-template`

```bash
git fetch paranext-extension-template main
```

For each extension, run the following (replace `<extension-name>` with each extension's folder name):

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix src/<extension-name> paranext-extension-template main --squash
```

## Special features in this project

This project has special features and specific configuration to make building extensions for Platform.Bible easier. In the following expandable section are a few important notes:

<details>
    <summary>Expand to read about special features in this project</summary>

### React WebView files - `.web-view.tsx`

Platform.Bible WebViews must be treated differently than other code, so this project makes doing that simpler:

- WebView code must be bundled and can only import specific packages provided by Platform.Bible (see `externals` in `webpack.config.base.ts`), so this project bundles React WebViews before bundling the main extension file to support this requirement. The project discovers and bundles files that end with `.web-view.tsx` in this way.
  - Note: while watching for changes, if you add a new `.web-view.tsx` file, you must either restart Webpack or make a nominal change and save in an existing `.web-view.tsx` file for Webpack to discover and bundle this new file.
- WebView code and styles must be provided to the `papi` as strings, so you can import WebView files with [`?inline`](#special-imports) after the file path to import the file as a string.

### Built-in Tailwind CSS support

This project is equipped with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) configured the same way it is configured in Platform.Bible's React component library `platform-bible-react` to enable WebViews to match Platform.Bible's look and feel. To add Tailwind CSS to your WebView, simply use your extension's `./src/tailwind.css` file in your WebView's style `.scss` file (note that you should not add the `.css` extension when using local CSS files into `.scss` files):

```scss
@use './path/to/src/tailwind';
```

Adding this import to your WebView's styles enables Tailwind CSS in the WebView. Alternatively, you can directly use `./src/tailwind.css` as your WebView's style file if you do not need any additional CSS. Important Tailwind configuration notes:

- This project's Tailwind's configuration is set up with the prefix `tw-`, so all Tailwind classes must have `tw-` at the beginning (e.g. `tw-bg-purple-500`).
- [Tailwind's preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) is enabled by default, meaning some default HTML tag styles are significantly modified. You can [disable it](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight#disabling-preflight) or [restrict its scope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-scoped-preflight) if desired. However, the preferred approach is generally to use [`@tailwindcss/typography`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), included in this project's Tailwind configuration by default, when displaying flowing content.
- You can apply theme colors using Tailwind classes corresponding to the CSS property and theme color variable name like `tw-bg-primary`.

Please see the wiki's [Tailwind CSS in WebViews](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template/wiki/Extension-Anatomy#webview-component) page for more information about using Tailwind in your WebView.

### Special imports

- Adding `?inline` to the end of a file import causes that file to be imported as a string after being transformed by Webpack loaders but before bundling dependencies (except if that file is a React WebView file, in which case dependencies will be bundled). The contents of the file will be on the file's default export.
  - Ex: `import myFile from './file-path?inline`
- Adding `?raw` to the end of a file import treats a file the same way as `?inline` except that it will be imported directly without being transformed by webpack.

### Misc features

- Platform.Bible extensions' code must be bundled all together in one file, so Webpack bundles all the code together into one main file per extension.
- Platform.Bible extensions can interact with other extensions, but they cannot import and export like in a normal Node environment. Instead, they interact through the `papi`. As such, each extension's `src/types` folder contains its declarations file that tells other extensions how to interact with it through the `papi`.

### Two-step Webpack build

These extensions are built by Webpack (`webpack.config.ts`) in two steps: a WebView bundling step and a main bundling step:

#### Build 1: TypeScript WebView bundling

Webpack (`./webpack/webpack.config.web-view.ts`) prepares TypeScript WebViews for use and outputs them into temporary build folders adjacent to the WebView files:

- Formats WebViews to match how they should look to work in Platform.Bible
- Transpiles React/TypeScript WebViews into JavaScript
- Bundles dependencies into the WebViews
- Embeds Sourcemaps into the WebViews inline

#### Build 2: Main and final bundling

Webpack (`./webpack/webpack.config.main.ts`) prepares the main extension files and bundles each extension together into the `dist` folder:

- Transpiles the main TypeScript file and its imported modules into JavaScript
- Injects the bundled WebViews into the main file
- Bundles dependencies into the main file
- Embeds Sourcemaps into the file inline
- Packages everything up into an extension folder `dist`
