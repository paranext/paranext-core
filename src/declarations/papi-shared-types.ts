   *    support the `platform.base` `projectInterface` and should instead implement
   *    {@link IProjectDataProvider}**. Instead of providing projects themselves, they likely use the
   *    `ExtensionData` data type exposed via the `platform.base` `projectInterface` on Base PDPs to
   *    provide additional project data on top of Base PDPs.
   *
   * All Base Project Data Provider Interfaces' data types **must** implement
   * {@link IBaseProjectDataProvider} (which extends {@link MandatoryProjectDataTypes}) like in the
   * following example. Please see its documentation for information on how Project Data Providers
   * can implement this interface.
   *
   * Note: The keys of this interface are the `projectInterface`s for the associated Project Data
   * Provider Interfaces. `projectInterface`s represent standardized sets of methods on a PDP.
   *
   * WARNING: Each Base Project Data Provider **must** fulfill certain requirements for its
