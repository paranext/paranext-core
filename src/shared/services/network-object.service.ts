/**
 * JSDOC SOURCE networkObjectService
 *
 * Network objects are distributed objects within PAPI for TS/JS objects. @see
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_object
 *
 * Objects registered via {@link networkObjectService.set} are retrievable using
 * {@link networkObjectService.get}.
 *
 * Function calls made on network objects retrieved via {@link networkObjectService.get} are proxied
 * and sent to the original objects registered via {@link networkObjectService.set}. All functions on
 * the registered object are proxied except for constructors, `dispose`, and functions starting with
 * `on` since those should be events (which are not intended to be proxied) based on our naming
 * convention. If you don't want a function to be proxied, don't make it a property of the
 * registered object.
 *
 * Functions on a network object will be called asynchronously by other processes regardless of
 * whether the functions are synchronous or asynchronous, so it is best to make them all
 * asynchronous. All shared functions' arguments and return values must be serializable to be called
 * across processes.
 *
 * When a service registers an object via {@link networkObjectService.set}, it is the responsibility
 * of that service, and only that service, to call `dispose` on that object when it is no longer
 * intended to be shared with other services.
 *
 * When an object is disposed by calling `dispose`, all functions registered with the `onDidDispose`
 * event handler will be called. After an object is disposed, calls to its functions will no longer
 * be proxied to the original object.
