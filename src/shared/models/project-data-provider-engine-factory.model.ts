/**
 * A factory object registered with the papi that creates a Project Data Provider Engine for each
 * project with the factory's specified `projectInterface`s when the papi requests. Used by the papi
 * to create {@link IProjectDataProviderEngine}s for a specific project and `projectInterface` when
 * someone gets a project data provider with `papi.projectDataProviders.get`. When this factory
 * object is registered with `papi.projectDataProviders.registerProjectDataProviderEngineFactory`,
 * the papi creates a {@link ProjectDataProviderFactory} that layers over this engine to create
 * {@link IProjectDataProvider}s.
 *
 * Project Data Provider Engine Factories create Project Data Provider Engines for specific
 * `projectInterface`s. For each project id available on a Project Data Provider Factory, the
 * factory that supports that project with some set of `projectInterface`s creates a new instance of
 * a PDP with the supported `projectInterface`s.
 *
 * A PDP Factory can provide its own unique project ids (Base PDP Factory) or layer over other PDPFs
 * and provide additional `projectInterface`s on those projects (Layering PDP Factory). Base PDP
 * Factories must create PDPs that support the `platform.base` `projectInterface`. See
 * {@link IBaseProjectDataProvider} and {@link ProjectDataProviderInterfaces} for more information.
 *
 * WARNING: For Layering PDPFs, `getAvailableProjects` has very specific requirements that
 * **absolutely must** be met. Please see
 * {@link IProjectDataProviderEngineFactory.getAvailableProjects} for more information on the
 * requirements.
 *
 * To make creating a Layering PDPF easier, you can extend
 * {@link LayeringProjectDataProviderEngineFactory}, which automatically fulfills the special
 * requirements for Layering PDPFs. We highly recommend using it.
