 * provider with `papi.webViewProviders.register`.
 *
 * Web View Providers provide the contents of all web views in Platform.Bible.
 *
 * If you want to provide {@link WebViewControllers} to facilitate interaction between your web views
 * and extensions, you can extend the abstract class {@link WebViewFactory} to make the process
 * easier. Alternatively, if you want to manage web view controllers manually, you can register them
 * in {@link IWebViewProvider.getWebView}.

   *
   * The PAPI calls this method as part of opening a new web view or (re)loading an existing web
   * view. If you want to create {@link WebViewControllers} for the web views the PAPI creates from
   * this method, you should register it using `papi.webViewProviders.registerWebViewController`
   * before returning from this method (resolving the returned promise). The {@link WebViewFactory}
   * abstract class handles this for you, so please consider extending it.
   *
   * @param savedWebViewDefinition The saved web view information from which to build a complete web
   *   view definition. Filled out with all {@link SavedWebViewDefinition} properties of the existing
   *   web view if an existing webview is being called for (matched by ID). Just provides the
   *   minimal properties required on {@link SavedWebViewDefinition} if this is a new request or if
   *   the web view with the existing ID was not found.
   * @param getWebViewOptions Various options that affect what calling `papi.webViews.openWebView`
   *   should do. When options are passed to `papi.webViews.openWebView`, some defaults are set up
   *   on the options, then those options are passed directly through to this method. That way, if
   *   you want to adjust what this method does based on the contents of the options passed to
   *   `papi.WebViews.openWebView`, you can. You can even read other properties on these options if
   *   someone passes options with other properties to `papi.webViews.openWebView`.
   * @param webViewNonce Nonce used to perform privileged interactions with the web view created
   *   from this method's returned {@link WebViewDefinition} such as
   *   `papi.webViewProviders.postMessageToWebView`. The web view service generates this nonce and
   *   sends it _only here_ to this web view provider that creates the web view with this id. It is
   *   generally recommended that this web view provider not share this nonce with anyone else but
   *   only use it within itself and in the web view controller created for this web view if
   *   applicable (See `papi.webViewProviders.registerWebViewController`).
   * @returns Full {@link WebViewDefinition} including the content and other important display
   *   properties based on the {@link SavedWebViewDefinition} provided
