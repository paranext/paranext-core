/**
 * Networked version of EventEmitter - accepts subscriptions to an event and runs the subscription
 * callbacks when the event is emitted. Events on NetworkEventEmitters can be emitted across
 * processes. They are coordinated between processes by their type. Use eventEmitter.event(callback)
 * to subscribe to the event. Use eventEmitter.emit(event) to run the subscriptions. Generally, this
 * EventEmitter should be private, and its event should be public. That way, the emitter is not
 * publicized, but anyone can subscribe to the event.
 *
 * WARNING: Do not use this class directly outside of NetworkService, or it will not do what you
 * expect. Use NetworkService.createNetworkEventEmitter.
 *
 * WARNING: You cannot emit events with complex types on the network.
