/**
 * JSDOC SOURCE WebViewFactory
 *
 * A partial implementation of {@link IWebViewProvider} that includes creating
 * {@link WebViewControllers} for each web view served by the web view provider. This class handles
 * registering, disposing, and making sure there is only one web view controller for each web view
 * for you.
 *
 * You can create a new class extending this abstract class to create a web view provider that
 * serves web views and web view controllers of a specific `webViewType` to facilitate interaction
 * between those web views and other extensions. You can register it with the PAPI using
 * `papi.webViewProviders.register`.
 *
 * If you want to change your existing `IWebViewProvider` from a plain object to extending this
 * class, you will need to change your object's existing method named `getWebView`
 * ({@link IWebViewProvider.getWebView}) to be named `getWebViewDefinition`
 * ({@link WebViewFactory.getWebViewDefinition}), which is a drop-in replacement. You likely do NOT
 * want to overwrite this class's `getWebView` because that will eliminate most of the benefits
 * associated with using this class.
 *
 * @see {@link IWebViewProvider} for more information on extending this class.
