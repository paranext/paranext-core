      DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT A SERIOUS REASON

      default-src 'none' so things can't happen unless we allow them
      script-src allows them to use script tags and in-line attribute scripts
        'self' so scripts can be loaded from us
        'unsafe-inline' because web view iframes use srcdoc right now, which inherits CSP from parent frames
          TODO: PLEASE FIX THIS - Move web views to be retrieved from the backend, and remove this. paranext-core#89
        TODO: change to script-src-elem so in-line attribute scripts like event handlers don't run? If this is actually more secure. paranext-core#89
      style-src allows them to use style/link tags and style attributes on tags
        'self' so styles can be loaded from us
        'unsafe-inline' because that's how our styles are currently loaded in by hot reloading
          TODO: PLEASE FIX THIS IN PRODUCTION. paranext-core#89
      frame-src 'self' so frame contents can be loaded from us
      worker-src 'self' so web workers can be loaded from us
      manifest-src 'self' so we can load our manifest
        TODO: What exactly does this do?
      connect-src only communicate over the network as we allow
        'self' communicate with us
        https: communicate with secure networks
        ws: communicate with webSockets
          TODO: try to template the specific url from ClientNetworkConnector in. paranext-core#89
      img-src 'self' and https: so they can load images from us and over secure connections
      media-src 'self' and https: so they can load audio, video, etc from us and over secure connections
      font-src 'self' and https: so they can load fonts from us and over secure connections
      form-action 'self' lets the form submit to us
        TODO: not sure if this is needed. If we can attach handlers to forms, we might be able to remove this
