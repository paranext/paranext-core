## States

âœ… "front"
means the tab that's selected in a tab group. In rc-dock, this is `dock-tab-active`
= "active" in rc-dock means the tab that is selected in a tab group.

âœ… "back"
means any tab that's not "front" in a tab group.
= "inactive" in rc-dock means any tab that is not "active" in a tab

âœ… "focus-within" means the tab that has CSS `:focus-within`, i.e. the tab with a cursor or keyboard focus within it. A tab with focus-within is always a "front" tab. Probably don't depend on `:focus-within` unless you specifically want that different behavior.
= "platform-dock-tab-window-focus" means the tab that has a window focus, i.e. the tab that is not "floating" and has a cursor or keyboard focus within it. Note that this include focus on the tab headerâ€”not only the content.

âœ… "blur" means the tab that does not have focus, i.e. the tab that is not "focus-within".

âœ… "highlight" means that a tab was recently made or has has a significant change. This is a temporary state that lasts a few seconds after the tab is activated or its content changes.
