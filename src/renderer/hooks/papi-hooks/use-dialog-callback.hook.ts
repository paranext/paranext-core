/**
 * JSDOC SOURCE useDialogCallback
 *
 * Enables using `papi.dialogs.showDialog` in React more easily. Returns a callback to run that will
 * open a dialog with the provided `dialogType` and `options` then run the `resolveCallback` with
 * the dialog response or `rejectCallback` if there is an error. By default, only one dialog can be
 * open at a time.
 *
 * If you need to open multiple dialogs and track which dialog is which, you can set
 * `options.shouldOpenMultipleDialogs` to `true` and add a counter to the `options` when calling the
 * callback. Then `resolveCallback` will be resolved with that options object including your
 * counter.
 *
 * @type `DialogTabType` The dialog type you are using. Should be inferred by parameters
 * @param dialogType Dialog type you want to show on the screen
 *
 *   Note: this parameter is internally assigned to a `ref`, so changing it will not cause any hooks
 *   to re-run with its new value. This means that updating this parameter will not cause a new
 *   callback to be returned. However, because of the nature of calling dialogs, this has no adverse
 *   effect on the functionality of this hook. Calling the callback will always use the latest
 *   `dialogType`.
 * @param options Various options for configuring the dialog that shows and this hook. If an
 *   `options` parameter is also provided to the returned `showDialog` callback, those
 *   callback-provided `options` merge over these hook-provided `options`
 *
 *   Note: this parameter is internally assigned to a `ref`, so changing it will not cause any hooks
 *   to re-run with its new value. This means that updating this parameter will not cause a new
 *   callback to be returned. However, because of the nature of calling dialogs, this has no adverse
 *   effect on the functionality of this hook. Calling the callback will always use the latest
 *   `options`.
 * @param resolveCallback `(response, dialogType, options)` The function that will be called if the
 *   dialog request resolves properly
 *
 *   - `response` - the resolved value of the dialog call. Either the user's response or `undefined` if
 *       the user cancels
 *   - `dialogType` - the value of `dialogType` at the time that this dialog was called
 *   - `options` the `options` provided to the dialog at the time that this dialog was called. This
 *       consists of the `options` provided to the returned `showDialog` callback merged over the
 *       `options` provided to the hook and additionally contains {@link UseDialogCallbackOptions}
 *       properties
 *
 *   Note: this parameter is internally assigned to a `ref`, so changing it will not cause any hooks
 *   to re-run with its new value. This means that updating this parameter will not cause a new
 *   callback to be returned. However, because of the nature of calling dialogs, this has no adverse
 *   effect on the functionality of this hook. When the dialog resolves, it will always call the
 *   latest `resolveCallback`.
 * @param rejectCallback `(error, dialogType, options)` The function that will be called if the
 *   dialog request throws an error
 *
 *   - `error` - the error thrown while calling the dialog
 *   - `dialogType` - the value of `dialogType` at the time that this dialog was called
 *   - `options` the `options` provided to the dialog at the time that this dialog was called. This
 *       consists of the `options` provided to the returned `showDialog` callback merged over the
 *       `options` provided to the hook and additionally contains {@link UseDialogCallbackOptions}

 *   effect on the functionality of this hook. If the dialog throws an error, it will always call
 *   the latest `rejectCallback`.
 * @returns `showDialog(options?)` - callback to run to show the dialog to prompt the user for a
 *   response
 *
 *   - `optionsOverrides?` - `options` object you may specify that will merge over the `options` you
 *       provide to the hook before passing to the dialog. All properties are optional, so you may
 *       specify as many or as few properties here as you want to overwrite the properties in the
 *       `options` you provide to the hook
