# Squash Message

Generate a cleaned-up squash-merge commit message: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This command drafts the **extended description** for GitHub's "Squash and merge" dialog. GitHub pre-fills that box with every branch commit's subject and body concatenated — including per-commit AI trailers, review-feedback fixups, and formatting noise. This command distills that history into a description of the change **as merged**, so `main`'s history reads like a changelog instead of a development diary.

Reminder: squash-merge is the team default, but **never** squash-merge template updates (see `.context/standards/Git-Guide.md`).

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:

```
[PR-number] [--repo <owner/name>]
```

- **PR number**: Optional (numeric token). If omitted, resolve from the current branch.
- **`--repo`**: Optional. If omitted, use the current directory's repo (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`).

## Step 1: Collect the branch history

```bash
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
PR=${PR:-$(gh pr list --head "$BRANCH" --state all --json number --jq '.[0].number' --repo "$REPO")}
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)
git log --reverse --format='%s%n%n%b%n----' "$MERGE_BASE..HEAD"
```

Also fetch the PR title and body (`gh pr view "$PR" --json title,body`) — the PR body (especially a review summary, if present) often states the change's intent better than any single commit.

## Step 2: Classify the commits

Sort each commit into one of:

| Category | Examples | In the squash message? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature/fix substance** | the main change; distinct sub-behaviors that survive in the merged code (a suppression rule, a fallback path, new diagnostics) | Yes |
| **Notable structure** | new reusable util/component/hook with tests; reuse of a shared util replacing a local duplicate | Yes, briefly |
| **Deferred-work markers** | "e2e tests deferred to follow-up PR (required by DoD)" | Yes — reviewers and future readers need the trail |
| **Review fixups subsumed by the feature** | a bug fixed before merge in code this same PR introduced | No — describe the final behavior, not the journey |
| **Formatting/style-only** | blank lines, prettier, lint sweeps, comment/TODO tweaks | No |
| **Test-only refinements** | extra cases, mutant kills | No, unless the coverage itself is the PR's point |
| **Per-commit trailers** | `Co-authored-by:`, `Session-URL:` on each commit | No — consolidate (Step 3) |

The test for inclusion: **would someone reading `git log main` a year from now need this line to understand what this commit changed or why?** Intermediate states of the branch fail that test; behaviors and decisions that persist in the merged code pass it.

## Step 3: Draft the message

Structure:

1. **Opening paragraph(s)** (1–2, wrapped at ~72 chars): what the change does as merged, in plain prose — behavior first, mechanism second. Write it from the final state of the code, not from the sequence of commits.
2. **Bullets** (optional, only if they add distinct facts): key sub-behaviors, notable structure, invariants a maintainer must know (e.g. "verse moves never re-run the C# query").
3. **Deferred-work note** (if any).
4. **Consolidated attribution**: exactly one `Co-authored-by:` line per distinct AI tool used on the branch, and one `Session-URL:` line per distinct session — deduplicated from all the per-commit trailers.

Do NOT include: commit-by-commit narration, "address review feedback" phrasing, style/formatting mentions, or repeated trailers.

**Title**: GitHub sets it to the PR title plus ` (#PR)`. Suggest a corrected title only if the PR title exceeds ~70 characters or no longer matches the merged content; otherwise leave it alone.

## Step 4: Output

Print the finished extended description in a single fenced code block, ready to paste over GitHub's pre-filled text, followed by a one-line note of anything you excluded that the author might disagree about (e.g. "dropped the mutant-kill test commit — say the word if you want it back").

Do not commit, push, or merge anything — this command only produces text.
