/**
 * Example data provider engine that provides easy access to Scripture from an internet API.
 *
 * It has three data types:
 *
 * - Verse: get a portion of Scripture by its reference. You can also change the Scripture at a
 *   reference, but you have to clarify that you are heretical because you really shouldn't change
 *   published Scriptures like this ;)
 * - Heresy: get or set Scripture freely. It automatically marks the verse as heretical if changed
 * - Chapter: get a whole chapter of Scripture by book name and chapter number. Read-only
 *
 *   - This data type is provided to demonstrate a more complex selector - an array of typed values.
 *       This is one way to make a `get<data_type>` function that feels more like a normal function
 *       that has "multiple" parameters in its selector.
 *
 * For each data type, an engine needs a `get<data_type>` and a `set<data_type>`.
 *
 * Papi will create a data provider that internally uses this engine. The data provider layers over
 * this engine and adds functionality like `subscribe<data_type>` functions with automatic updates.
 *
 * This data provider engine is defined by a class, which we recommend trying once you get
 * comfortable with the data provider api because of the following pros and cons:
 *
 * - Pros
 *
 *   - Can freely add properties and methods without specifying them in an extra type
 *   - Can use private methods (prefix with `#`) that are automatically ignored by papi
 *   - Can use `@papi.dataProviders.decorators.ignore` to tell papi to ignore methods
 *   - Can extend `DataProviderEngine` so TypeScript will understand you can call `this.notifyUpdate`
 *       without specifying a `notifyUpdate` function
 *   - Can easily create multiple data providers from the same engine if you have two independent sets
 *       of data or something
 * - Cons
 *
 *   - Intellisense does not tell you all the `set<data_type>` and `get<data_type>` methods you need to
 *       provide, so it is slightly more challenging to use. However, TypeScript still shows an
 *       error unless you have the right methods.
 *   - You must specify parameter and return types. They are not inferred
 *
 * If you would like better Intellisense support to get familiar with the api, you can alternatively
 * define a data provider engine with an object. An example of this is found in `hello-someone.ts`.
