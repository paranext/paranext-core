    This evil webview comes from a file! It is served at
    `papi-extension:evil/assets/evil.web-view.html`. It is trying to do bad things. If you see an
    error in the console like '&lt;&lt;BAD&gt;&gt; EVIL WEB VIEW FILE...', it did bad things. But if
    you see this message without seeing errors like that, it probably wasn't able to do bad things!
    :)
