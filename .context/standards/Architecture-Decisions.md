# Architecture Decisions

A lightweight, append-only log of **significant architecture decisions** and the reasoning behind
them. It holds the one thing the prescriptive standards (`Architecture.md`,
`Paranext-Core-Patterns.md`, `.claude/rules/`) can't: the **why**, the **alternatives we rejected**,
and the **history** (including superseded decisions).

This is **not** a gate and **not** the old ai-porting decision registry — no schema, no approval
step, no automation. Just a record.

## How to use it

- **Record significant decisions as they happen, in any code work** — not only during
  `/investigate-prd`. "Significant" = cross-cutting choices, a new pattern or top-level structure,
  deferring a platform capability, where a feature lives, or choosing one approach over viable
  alternatives. Skip routine/local choices.
- **Promote settled conventions.** When a decision hardens into a rule everyone should follow, also
  fold the rule into the relevant standard (`Architecture.md`, `Paranext-Core-Patterns.md`) or a
  `.claude/rules/` file — that is what the agents read and enforce on the next feature. This log
  keeps the rationale and history; the standards keep the current rule.
- **Don't rewrite history.** Mark a superseded decision `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` instead of deleting
  it; add the new decision as a new entry.
- **Append at the end**, newest last. Number entries `ADR-NNNN`.

### Entry template

```markdown
## ADR-NNNN: {short title}

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNNN
- **Context:** what situation forced a decision (with file:line / source where useful).
- **Decision:** what we chose.
- **Alternatives:** what we considered and why we rejected/deferred them.
- **Consequences:** what this enables or constrains; when to revisit.
```

## ADR-0001: Keep a lightweight, gate-free architecture-decisions log

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Feature and PRD work surfaces cross-cutting architecture decisions whose rationale
  would otherwise be stranded in PR descriptions and commit messages and re-litigated later. The
  retired ai-porting workflow had a gated decision registry (`decision-registry.json` + schema +
  `Decisions.md` + per-feature folders); the gate and bookkeeping were deliberately dropped with the
  rest of that harness, but the value of recording rationale remained unaddressed.
- **Decision:** Maintain this file as the home for significant architecture decisions + rationale.
  No gate, no schema, no automation. CLAUDE.md instructs all code work to update it; settled
  conventions are additionally promoted into the standards/rules; `pt10-reuse-scout` reads it during
  `/investigate-prd` so future investigations inherit prior decisions.
- **Alternatives:** (a) standards-only — rejected: the standards capture current rules but not the
  *why*, the rejected options, or the history. (b) Reinstate the ai-porting gated registry —
  rejected: that is exactly the harness we shed.
- **Consequences:** low-friction capture; the next PRD's scout benefits automatically. The cost is
  discipline — the log only helps if it is actually updated, which is why CLAUDE.md makes updating it
  a standing instruction rather than an optional nicety.

## ADR-0002: App-global keyboard shortcuts go through the main-process `before-input-event` handler

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted (current approach)
- **Context:** The core Send/Receive investigation found paranext-core has **no declarative
  keybinding/accelerator contribution API** — the menu-item contribution schema even rejects an
  `accelerator` field (`unevaluatedProperties: false`). The only existing app-global keyboard
  handling is the Electron main-process `before-input-event` handler in `src/main/main.ts`
  (~lines 606-679: F12, zoom, Ctrl+Tab), which already imports `commandService` and calls
  `commandService.sendCommand`.
- **Decision:** Add new app-global keyboard shortcuts as branches in that `before-input-event`
  handler, each invoking the target PAPI command (e.g. F9 → `command:paratextBibleSendReceive.openSendReceive`).
  Do **not** build a general declarative keybinding API for a single shortcut.
- **Alternatives:** (a) renderer-level global `keydown` — rejected: web-view iframes are
  `about:srcdoc`, so their key events don't bubble to the top renderer; coverage gaps unless
  duplicated into every web-view. (b) Build a declarative keybinding-contribution API — **deferred**:
  multi-week, touches the menu schema, `platform-bible-utils` types, the macOS/renderer menubars,
  generated `papi.d.ts`, and docs.
- **Consequences:** shortcuts are app-global and cross-platform from one place; couples `main.ts` to
  an extension's command name by string (degrades gracefully if the extension is absent). **Revisit**
  (and likely supersede this) once enough shortcuts accumulate to justify the declarative API.
