# Architecture Decisions

> Verified against paranext-core origin/main `998ca09a087` — 2026-08-03.

A lightweight, append-only log of **significant architecture decisions** and the reasoning behind
them. It holds the one thing the prescriptive standards (`Architecture.md`,
`Paranext-Core-Patterns.md`, `.claude/rules/`) can't: the **why**, the **alternatives we rejected**,
and the **history** (including superseded decisions).

This is **not** a gate and **not** the old ai-porting decision registry — no schema, no approval
step, no automation. Just a record.

## How to use it

- **Record significant decisions as they happen, in any code work** — not only during
  `/investigate-prd`. "Significant" = cross-cutting choices, a new pattern or top-level structure,
  deferring a platform capability, where a feature lives, or choosing one approach over viable
  alternatives. Skip routine/local choices.
- **Promote settled conventions.** When a decision hardens into a rule everyone should follow, also
  fold the rule into the relevant standard (`Architecture.md`, `Paranext-Core-Patterns.md`) or a
  `.claude/rules/` file — that is what the agents read and enforce on the next feature. This log
  keeps the rationale and history; the standards keep the current rule.
- **Don't rewrite history.** Mark a superseded decision `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` instead of deleting
  it; add the new decision as a new entry.
- **Append at the end**, newest last. Number entries `ADR-NNNN`.

### Entry template

```markdown
## ADR-NNNN: {short title}

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNNN
- **Context:** what situation forced a decision (with file:line / source where useful).
- **Decision:** what we chose.
- **Alternatives:** what we considered and why we rejected/deferred them.
- **Consequences:** what this enables or constrains; when to revisit.
```

## ADR-0001: Keep a lightweight, gate-free architecture-decisions log

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Feature and PRD work surfaces cross-cutting architecture decisions whose rationale
  would otherwise be stranded in PR descriptions and commit messages and re-litigated later. The
  retired ai-porting workflow had a gated decision registry (`decision-registry.json` + schema +
  `Decisions.md` + per-feature folders); the gate and bookkeeping were deliberately dropped with the
  rest of that harness, but the value of recording rationale remained unaddressed.
- **Decision:** Maintain this file as the home for significant architecture decisions + rationale.
  No gate, no schema, no automation. CLAUDE.md instructs all code work to update it; settled
  conventions are additionally promoted into the standards/rules; `pt10-reuse-scout` reads it during
  `/investigate-prd` so future investigations inherit prior decisions.
- **Alternatives:** (a) standards-only — rejected: the standards capture current rules but not the
  *why*, the rejected options, or the history. (b) Reinstate the ai-porting gated registry —
  rejected: that is exactly the harness we shed.
- **Consequences:** low-friction capture; the next PRD's scout benefits automatically. The cost is
  discipline — the log only helps if it is actually updated, which is why CLAUDE.md makes updating it
  a standing instruction rather than an optional nicety.

## ADR-0002: App-global keyboard shortcuts go through the main-process `before-input-event` handler

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted (current approach)
- **Context:** The core Send/Receive investigation found paranext-core has **no declarative
  keybinding/accelerator contribution API** — the menu-item contribution schema even rejects an
  `accelerator` field (`unevaluatedProperties: false`). The only existing app-global keyboard
  handling is the Electron main-process `before-input-event` handler in `src/main/main.ts`
  (~lines 663-798: F12, Ctrl+Tab, tab-group navigation, zoom), which already imports
  `commandService` and calls `commandService.sendCommand`.
- **Decision:** Add new app-global keyboard shortcuts as branches in that `before-input-event`
  handler, each invoking the target PAPI command (e.g. F6 → `command:paratextBibleSendReceive.openSendReceive`;
  pick a key that is genuinely free — F8/F9 are taken by chapter/book navigation in
  `src/main/verse-navigation-shortcuts.util.ts`). Do **not** build a general declarative keybinding
  API for a single shortcut. Every added branch also requires a matching `KeyboardShortcutEntry` in
  `src/stories/keyboard-shortcuts.data.ts` (mandated by `.claude/rules/keyboard-shortcuts-catalog.md`).
- **Alternatives:** (a) renderer-level global `keydown` — rejected: web-view iframes are
  `about:srcdoc`, so their key events don't bubble to the top renderer; coverage gaps unless
  duplicated into every web-view. (b) Build a declarative keybinding-contribution API — **deferred**:
  multi-week, touches the menu schema, `platform-bible-utils` types, the macOS/renderer menubars,
  generated `papi.d.ts`, and docs.
- **Consequences:** shortcuts are app-global and cross-platform from one place; couples `main.ts` to
  an extension's command name by string (degrades gracefully if the extension is absent). **Revisit**
  (and likely supersede this) once enough shortcuts accumulate to justify the declarative API.

## ADR-0003: Menus stay always-available; back ends gate at submission. Writers of mutable shared state are DataProviders, not NetworkObjects

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Two placement questions recur when porting a PT9 tool that mutates project data.
  (a) PT9 menu items hide/disable themselves via predicate evaluation before render
  (permission checks, project-state guards). paranext-core's menu system has **no arbitrary
  predicate/expression gating** of menu visibility — the one supported declarative axis is
  `MenuItemBase.hiddenInterfaceModes` (`lib/platform-bible-utils/src/extension-contributions/menus.model.ts`,
  enforced by `filterItemsForInterfaceMode` in `src/extension-host/services/menu-data.service-host.ts`), which hides an item per interface mode; beyond
  that the schema cannot express "show only if X." (b) When a
  C# layer mutates shared state that DataProvider subscribers observe (via `useProjectSetting` and
  similar), where the mutation lives determines whether external PAPI callers stay in sync. A
  `NetworkObject` method is a publicly callable mutation with **no subscribable surface** — any
  consumer (another extension, a debug tool, another part of the platform) can call it, and
  subscribers do not learn the state changed (surfaced in the keyboard-switching port:
  an OS-keyboard `activate(id)` on a NetworkObject let the activation service's cached state silently
  diverge from reality).
- **Decision:**
  - **Menus stay always-available.** Do not build per-feature predicate-gated menu visibility. The
    back end performs permission/state checks **at submission time** and surfaces failures as
    `PlatformError` codes (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, etc.). Document the PT9
    visibility/enable rules inline at the command/handler, not in a separate file.
  - **The actual writer of mutable shared state should be a DataProvider, not a NetworkObject**, so
    the `set` action propagates a change event to subscribers automatically. Reserve `NetworkObject`
    for stateless query/command functions with no subscription semantics. (Precedent for the
    promotion: `c-sharp/Checks/InventoryDataProvider.cs` — subclass `NetworkObjects.DataProvider`,
    return `(functionName, Delegate)` pairs from `GetFunctions()` (paired `getX`/`setX`, with
    `subscribeX` auto-generated per data type), and fire updates via the inherited
    `SendDataUpdateEvent(dataType, …)`.)
- **Alternatives:** (menus) build a declarative predicate-visibility API — deferred: large surface
  (menu schema, utils types, generated `papi.d.ts`, docs) for marginal benefit when submission-time
  checks already give correct behavior. (writer placement) keep the NetworkObject and require all
  callers to round-trip through a higher-level service — rejected: a registered PAPI object's surface
  is public and direct calls cannot be prevented; adding a custom event on the NetworkObject just
  reinvents the DataProvider pattern poorly.
- **Consequences:** simpler menu wiring at the cost of a worse error experience for actions the user
  could have been prevented from triggering (acceptable today; **revisit** if predicate visibility
  becomes common enough to justify the API). Promoting a writer to a DataProvider adds modest
  boilerplate (base class + data-type triples + update plumbing) but keeps external mutations
  observable, which is load-bearing whenever any subscriber caches the state.
- **Source:** manage-books port (menu-availability deferred); keyboard-switching port (OS-keyboard
  NetworkObject → DataProvider promotion). See `Entry-Point-Guide.md` for the menu mechanics
  and `Paranext-Core-Patterns.md` for the DataProvider-vs-NetworkObject pattern.

## ADR-0004: Surface ParatextData alerts via `AlertCapture` instead of swallowing them

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Many ParatextData operations report user-facing warnings/errors through `Alert.Show` /
  `Alert.ShowLater` (e.g. an SFM import can raise a dozen alerts in one call). Headless PT10 has no
  dialog to show them, so the prior `AlertStub` returned `AlertResult.Negative` and **discarded the
  message** — the caller silently lost every warning. Both `c-sharp/ParatextUtils/AlertCapture.cs`
  and the consuming call sites in `c-sharp/ManageBooks/` already ship; this records *why* so the next
  feature applies the pattern instead of reinventing alert handling.
- **Decision:** Install `AlertCapture : Alert` as the `Alert.Implementation` at startup. Wrap any
  ParatextData call that may raise alerts in `using var scope = AlertCapture.StartCapture();` and
  project `scope.Entries` (`AlertEntry[]`) into the wire result (partition by level into
  `Warnings`/`Errors`). `AsyncLocal` isolates the capture scope per async flow so concurrent wire
  calls do not cross-contaminate; nested scopes save/restore the parent on dispose; an allow-list
  drops the recurring English-language-definition probe alert. The no-scope path falls back to
  `Console.WriteLine` + `AlertResult.Negative`.
- **Alternatives:** keep `AlertStub` (swallow alerts) — rejected: import-style flows legitimately
  produce warnings/errors the user must see. Reinstall a fresh `Alert.Implementation` per request —
  rejected: `AsyncLocal` scoping is cleaner and inherently concurrency-safe. Use `Alert.Show` from
  orchestrator code as poor-man's logging — rejected: return the structured `AlertEntry[]` field
  instead.
- **Consequences:** ParatextData warnings become structured, returnable data rather than lost
  side-effects; any future ParatextData wrapper that raises alerts can opt in by opening a scope.
  The cost is remembering to open a scope around the call — outside a scope, alerts still vanish.
- **Source:** manage-books port (`AlertCapture` introduced for `ImportBooks`). See
  `Paranext-Core-Patterns.md` for the code pattern.

## ADR-0005: PT10 has no production create-project primitive

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Porting the project backup-and-restore feature surfaced a "restore as a **new**
  project" goal that assumed PT10 could create a project from nothing (PT9 does this via
  `ProjectPropertiesForm` + `VersioningManager.EnsureHasGuid` + `ScrTextCollection.Add`). A
  verification grep (2026-05-19, re-confirmed against the current tree) found **no production
  create-project primitive** in paranext-core: no `CreateProject` / `AddProject` for new projects, no
  `ProjectPropertiesForm` equivalent. The C# factory only registers PDPs for projects **already on
  disk** (`createProjectDataProviderEngine` is PDP-**engine** registration, not project creation); the
  only create-project references are the `hello-rock3.createNewProject` sample extension (registered
  and handled, but it creates its own non-ParatextData sample data, not a ParatextData/ScrText
  project) and unregistered test/menu fixtures. Reading an existing project's Guid works
  (via `ScrText.Guid`, a ParatextData primitive); **creating** a Guid for a brand-new project does
  not, because that path is Mercurial-backed and PT10 does not touch Mercurial.
- **Decision:** Treat "create a new project" as an **unavailable platform capability**. Features that
  would need it must scope to existing-project flows only (backup-and-restore ships overlay-restore
  to an existing destination, not restore-to-new-project). `/investigate-prd` should flag any PRD
  that depends on project creation as blocked on this gap rather than designing around a primitive
  that does not exist.
- **Alternatives:** build a create-project primitive as part of the feature — rejected: it is a
  cross-cutting platform capability (storage layout, Guid assignment, ScrTextCollection indexing,
  the PT9-coexistence `shortName_projectGuid` folder-naming question), not a per-feature concern. A
  not-necessarily-unique fallback Guid in paranext-core with the real Mercurial-backed mechanism in
  paratext-10-studio was floated but not built.
- **Consequences:** restore-to-new-project and any similar net-new-project flow stay out of scope
  until the platform grows the primitive. **Revisit** when a production create-project capability
  lands — at which point the Guid-**creation** question (and PT9-coexistence folder naming) must be
  resolved before such flows can be wired end-to-end.
- **Source:** project backup-and-restore port (restore-to-new-project scope cut, PT10 source grep
  2026-05-19).

## ADR-0006: Reuse the shared checklist framework when porting a new checklist tool

- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PT9 has a family of checklist tools (markers, punctuation, ...) sharing one WinForms
  framework. The markers checklist was ported first and deliberately landed the reusable pieces in
  `c-sharp/Checklists/` and `extensions/src/platform-scripture/`. Inspecting the merged markers port
  showed that a second checklist (punctuation) needs far less net-new code than a from-scratch port
  implied — most of the framework is already there to consume.
- **Decision:** When porting any additional checklist tool, **reuse the shared framework** rather
  than re-extracting it from PT9:
  - **Consume directly** (no new C#): the `IChecklistService` network object
    (`platformScripture.checklistService`, `c-sharp/Checklists/ChecklistService.cs` /
    `ChecklistNetworkObject.cs`), including `resolveComparativeTexts`; the shared data model
    (`ChecklistResult` / `ChecklistRow` / `ChecklistCell` / `ChecklistParagraph` and the polymorphic
    `ChecklistContentItem` subtypes — `text` / `verse` / `editLink` / `link` / `error` / `message` —
    plus their TS mirrors); the goto-link callback + linked-reference button.
  - **Re-extract small pieces into the new tool's own service** (tens of LOC): the per-tool
    comparison loop and the row-count cap + `Truncated` flag.
  - **Small upstream addition**: add a non-merging row builder
    (`ChecklistRowBuilder.BuildRowsNonMergingCells`, by parameterizing `MaxCellsToGrab`) — today
    `ChecklistRowBuilder` only exposes `BuildRowsMergingCells`, which markers uses. Keep markers on
    the merging mode.
  - **Pattern-copy, no shared class yet**: the `useWebViewState` slot pattern and the
    `checklist.component.tsx` structure (a shared `ChecklistTable` extraction is plausible only once
    the markers UI settles).
- **Alternatives:** extract the whole framework abstractly from PT9 for each new tool — rejected:
  markers already landed what is reusable; per-tool re-extraction would produce parallel/duplicate
  code.
- **Consequences:** a new checklist is mostly TS + a thin per-tool service. **Watch the verse-range
  divergence:** PT9's checklist verse range is **global** across checklist tools, but PT10 markers
  stores it **per-instance** via `useWebViewState`; a new sibling that copies markers inherits the
  per-instance behavior. The global-range fix is tracked upstream and will apply to all siblings when
  it lands — do not re-solve it per tool.
- **Source:** punctuation-checklist port (markers-consumption verdict); see `08_Checklists.md` in the
  PT9 feature inventory for the per-tool behavior and the verse-range divergence.

## ADR-0007: The MIT carve-out under `lib/` is drawn by runtime linking, not by dependency section

- **Date:** 2026-08-07
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The repository relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later. A blanket relicense was not
  viable: Platform.Bible's extension model expects third parties to build and distribute their own
  extensions, and those extensions import Platform.Bible's developer libraries. If those libraries
  were AGPL, every third-party extension would inherit AGPL obligations simply by being built —
  which would make the platform's own extension model a copyleft trap. So some packages under `lib/`
  had to stay MIT. The initial split was justified package by package, with no single stated
  principle, and it did not survive scrutiny: `eslint-plugin-paranext` and
  `browserslist-config-detect-electron` were kept MIT despite contributing nothing to any extension,
  so the carve-out was protecting packages that needed no protection.
- **Decision:** Draw the boundary with one rule, recorded in
  [`LICENSING.md`](../../LICENSING.md#the-rule-that-draws-the-line):

  > **MIT if a third-party extension links against the package at runtime — whether webpack bundles
  > it in or Platform.Bible supplies it as an external. AGPL-3.0-or-later if the package exists only
  > while the extension is being built and the extension never links against it.**

  Applied to the five packages under `lib/`:

  | Package                               | License           | Why                                                     |
  | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `platform-bible-react`                | MIT               | Linked at runtime; webpack bundles it into extension output |
  | `platform-bible-utils`                | MIT               | Linked at runtime; not bundled — supplied as a webpack external |
  | `papi-dts`                            | AGPL-3.0-or-later | Types only; declarations erased at compile time          |
  | `browserslist-config-detect-electron` | AGPL-3.0-or-later | Build-time browserslist config; emits nothing            |
  | `eslint-plugin-paranext`              | AGPL-3.0-or-later | Lint-time only; emits nothing                            |

  The rule keys on **runtime linking**, deliberately and explicitly not on which `package.json`
  section declares the package, and not on bundling either — `platform-bible-utils` is an external
  and reaches a third-party extension without being bundled into it, yet the extension is combined
  with it just the same.
- **Alternatives:** relicense everything, including the `lib/` packages — rejected: it makes the AGPL
  viral for third-party extensions and defeats the extension model. Key the rule on the
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies` section — rejected because that field was already wrong:
  `platform-bible-react` was declared a `devDependency` by every extension in this repository while
  extension source across all of them imported it at runtime, so a mechanical "devDependency means
  AGPL" reading would have relicensed exactly the package the carve-out exists to protect.
  (The declarations were corrected to `dependencies` alongside this decision, but the rule still must
  not depend on them.) Keep all four originally-MIT `lib/` packages MIT — rejected: two of them
  contribute nothing to extension output, so the carve-out bought no protection there and the
  boundary no longer tracked a single principle.
- **Consequences:** a directory's own `LICENSE` file governs that directory, and the MIT side is now
  exactly `lib/platform-bible-react/` and `lib/platform-bible-utils/` — not `lib/` as a whole.
  Moving code across that boundary in either direction is a relicensing act requiring the copyright
  holders' agreement, not a refactor. `papi-dts` is AGPL yet imposes nothing on extension authors,
  because TypeScript erases its declarations at compile time and no part of it reaches a built
  extension. The sharpest ongoing constraint: **adding a runtime import of a currently-AGPL
  build-time package from extension source is a licensing change, not just a build change** — it
  would put AGPL bytes into a third-party extension's distributed output. Check
  `extensions/webpack/webpack.config.base.ts` `externals` to determine what a given import actually
  bundles. **Revisit** if a package changes character — e.g. if `eslint-plugin-paranext` ever grew a
  runtime helper that extensions import.
- **Source:** the AGPL relicense (`LICENSING.md`, per-directory `LICENSE` files); rule settled during
  the relicense code review.

## ADR-0008: The notices generator reproduces canonical SPDX texts from the repo, and every dual-license election is recorded per ecosystem

- **Date:** 2026-08-07
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` listed 28 of 88 NuGet packages (and 19 npm packages) as an
  identifier plus a copyright line with no license text at all, because those packages declare a
  license but bundle no file. For MIT and its relatives that is short of "this permission notice
  shall be included in all copies". Separately, `CsvHelper` shipped as `MS-PL OR Apache-2.0` with no
  recorded election, even though the npm side already had `ELECTED_LICENSES` for exactly that
  ambiguity — and MS-PL is GPL-incompatible while `ParanextDataProvider`, which links it, is now
  AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- **Decision:** (a) Check the canonical SPDX text of each needed identifier into
  `.erb/scripts/license-texts/<SPDX-ID>.txt` and have the generator reproduce it, labelled as SPDX's
  text and paired with the package's own copyright notice, whenever a package resolves an identifier
  but ships no file. (b) Record dual-license elections in a per-ecosystem map —
  `ELECTED_LICENSES` (npm) and `DOTNET_ELECTED_LICENSES` (NuGet) — render the elected branch beside
  the expression it was elected from, and classify the elected branch rather than the declared
  expression. `CsvHelper` is elected Apache-2.0.
- **Alternatives:** fetch the canonical texts at generation time — rejected: CI regenerates the
  artifact on every pull request and fails on a stale copy, so a network dependency would make a
  legal artifact depend on a third-party host's availability and on whatever it served that day.
  Fill SPDX's `<year>` / `<copyright holders>` placeholders from package metadata — rejected: that
  invents a copyright holder. Leave the identifier-only rows as they were — rejected: the attribution
  obligation attaches to the distributed binary regardless of how the upstream packaged its repo.
- **Consequences:** the generation path must stay hermetic — **nothing in it may open a socket**, and
  a new identifier needs a new checked-in text rather than a fetch. The generated file names the
  packages it could not reproduce a text for, so the gap reports itself. A dependency whose license
  is an `OR` expression must have its election recorded before it can be described accurately;
  an unelected `OR` still passes the copyleft gate (a disjunction classifies as its best branch), so
  the gate is not the thing that catches it — reading the artifact is. **Revisit** if the data
  provider takes a dependency whose only permissive branch is GPL-incompatible, or if a shipped
  product ever needs notices generated per-platform rather than from the Linux closure.
- **Source:** code review of the AGPL relicense branch; `LICENSING.md`,
  `.erb/scripts/license-texts/README.md`.
